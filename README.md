## Deprecated and Not maintained. 
Instead, ask [Chukwuemeka-Ike](https://github.com/Chukwuemeka-Ike) for access to SenSEApp, which is currently under development.

This repository was used as a proof of concept to show that Chaquopy could be used to do the underlying matrix-intensive work that 
the SenSE Observer-Based Filter used. Credits are due to Emmanuel Sylvester and Noah Lape for their collaboration on it.
